# Description 

Created a simple calendar scheduler application that allows the user to input data to be saved for future recall. The application has HTML and CSS that is dynamically updated every time the page is refreshed.

# Usage

The user would input information within time blocks of choice and the data would be stored in localStorage. The time stamp of the calendar changes changes as the day changes along with the time block times. Color-coded for the users, the past time would be shown as gray, present as red and the future time period on the scheduler as green.
